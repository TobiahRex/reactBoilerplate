# _React Boilerplate_:  Full-Stack REACT & Redux App Boilerplate
<!-- ### Deployed on Heroku [here](https://itiner-ez.herokuapp.com/). -->

##### Created: 6 October 2016

#### DESCRIPTION: Cannibalized from Templates and Boilerplates around the web.
  * Focuses on outsourcing API calls with _apisauce_.
  * Uses _redux-sagas_ to call customized api methods.
  * Uses _redux-logger_ to allow for informative workflow from the devtools console.  
  * Uses _redux dev tools extension_ to allow for a macro perspective picture of your current store's state.
  * Airbnb Style Guide implemented.

#### Setup:
#####1) "npm install"
#####2) "npm start" for development server
#####3) "npm build" for production server
#####NOTE) Highly recommend running npm update --save to update package json before running "npm start" or "npm build".

#### NOTE on Reducers:
Redux reducer methods rely on user to customize the logic to maintain immutability of state. This was done intentionally to strengthen developers abilities in manipulating state.  (If this feels cumbersome, I highly recommend using _redux-sauce_ & _seamless-immutable_ to outsource this process in a very clean, and simple way).
