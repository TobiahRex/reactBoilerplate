/*
  Every component you bring into this file, comes in as a "Connect" function.

  This Connect function will "Connect" the mapStateToProps & the
  mapDispatchToProps, to a specified route path, and to a specified parent
  component by react router. This parent component will be rendered as a
  funciton inside index.js.  Inside index.js, the Provider element will pass
  down store (state) to these parent components, whih will pass down the state
  to the mapping functions, which will cause a series of chain reactions at
  lower and lower levels until each component is finally given it's required
  information.
